2) Difference between arrays and linked list.
   i) Memory allocation.
     Arrays.
   - An Array is a collection of homogeneous data elements in a contiguous memory.
   - Arrays store large amounts of data that are of the same type.
   - The data elements in an array are stored in a linear order.
     Linked list.
   - A linked list is a linear collection of data elements.
   - The data elements are known as nodes. Each node stores the address of the next node, each node contains one or more than one data field and an address field that stores the address of the next node.
   - A Linked list is dynamic where by the memory is allocated as when it is required.
