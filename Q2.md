2) Difference between arrays and linked list.
   **i) Memory allocation.**
     Arrays.
   - An Array is a collection of homogeneous data elements in a contiguous memory.
   - Arrays store large amounts of data that are of the same type.
   - The data elements in an array are stored in a linear order.
     Linked list.
   - A linked list is a linear collection of data elements.
   - The data elements are known as nodes. Each node stores the address of the next node, each node contains one or more than one data field and an address field that stores the address of the next node.
   - A Linked list is dynamic where by the memory is allocated as when it is required.

   **ii) Performance.**
   - Arrays allow direct access to the data using indexing. This is beacuse the collection of data elements in an array is contigous and thus allows a linear search in an unsorted array and a binary search in a sorted array.
   - A linked list however does not allow direct access to the data since the elements are stored separately in nodes. Therefore in order to access the data elements, a traversing action must be done so as to obtain the required data element.
     
   **iii) Insertion and deletion.**
   - Under arrays, during the insertion of data at the beginning, all the data elements must be shifted to the right side so as to create space for the new data elements while if the arrays are at the middle, the elements after the insertion must be shifted to the right.
   - During deletion of arrays, if the array is the end, the last element of that array is removed and if the array appears at the beginning, the elements of that array must be shifted to the left side to fill the gap.
   - Insertion of data in linked list occurs in the nodes whereby if the linked list is at the beginning, an update will be performed on the header pointer to the new node, and if the linked list is at the end and a tail pointer is maintained, the traversal method will be used.
   - Deletion of a linked list involves moving the header pointer to the next node if the linked list is at the beginning, and if the the linked list deletion occurs at the end, the second last node is traversed to remove the last node in a singly linked list.
