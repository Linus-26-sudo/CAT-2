1) Rules of Big O Notation in algorithim analysis.
a) Focus on the dominant term.
- Under this rule, only the trem with the highest growth rate matters.
- Example: O(n2 + n) = O(n2)
- In the example above, the n term is the dominant term. Therefore as n becomes dominant, the n2 term will overshadow the n term since it dominates twice faster then the other term. Thus having the result as O(n2).

b) Ignore constants. 
- In this rule, the coeffients and lower order terms are irrelevant for large input sizes.
- Example: O(2n) = O(n)
- As shown in the example in the above, the constant value, that is '2', has been ignored and it coeffient, which is 'n' has been selected. The complexity of data is simplified by dropping coeffients since the do not impact the growth rate for large inputs.

c) Dropping non-dominant terms.
- In a combined complexity, the term with the highest growth rate is retained and the other terms are discarded since the are insignificant for large input sizes.
- Example: O(n + n2 + logn) = O(n2)
- The example clearly shows that n2 is the dominant term because its growth rate is much faster than the other terms (n, logn). Therefore the overall complexity simplifies to O(n2).

d) Constant time operations.
- Under constant time operations, these are the kind of operations that take the same amount of time to be executed regardless of the input size.
- Example: O(1).
- Constant time operations are more efficient, since they are not affected by the input size.

e) Consider input size changes.
- When the input size reduces, the time complexity of the algorithim will present a logarithimic growth which is denoted as O(logn).
- This occurs since the number of operations required grows in proportion to the logarithim of the input size.
